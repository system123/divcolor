Tensorflow implementation of Deshpande et al. "[Learning Diverse Image Colorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01958)"                 

The code is tested for Tensorflow-v1.0.1 and python-2.7. The code additionally needs numpy, scipy,
scikit-learn and caffe-r1.0 (caffe only for Zhang et al. colorization network).  

Fetch data by

```
bash get_data.sh
```

Fetch Zhang et al. colorization network for MDN features by

```
bash get_zhang_colorization.sh
```

Execute run_lfw.sh to first train vae+mdn and then, generate results for LFW

```
bash run_lfw.sh
```

Execute run_demo.sh to get diverse colorization for any image, the model is trained on imagenet

```
bash run_demo.sh
```
